### About Me
I am 23 years old, I work as an economist. 
I think that my real work will someday lead me to stagnation.
I have no real experience in front-end development. 
But I am ready to learn new things and achieve goals. 
My goal is to gain knowledge in front-end development.

I have such personal qualities as the ability to easily 
find contact with people, self-condidence, the ability to set priorities,
the ability to effectively plan your time, creative thinking,
attention to detail, the ability to work in the time.
